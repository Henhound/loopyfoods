_(Single-Source-of-Truth for ChatGPT & Dev Notes)_

---

## 🧭 0. TL;DR

- **Game type:** Turn-based autobattler inspired by Super Auto Pets, the Bazaar, and Balatro. Themed as a cooking competition.
- **Core loop:** Shop → Arrange → Battle → Repeat.
- **Goal:** Create a playable prototype to test fun factor before backend work.
- **Tech stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + DnD-Kit (frontend only).
- **Out of scope (for now):** Firebase, accounts, leaderboards, persistence, opposing players will be placeholders for the prototype.

## 🎮 1. Game Flow

1. **Main Menu** – shows “Play” button.
2. **Shop Screen** – Player can buy and sell food cards. There will also be a separate area to buy/sell judge cards. The player can also rearrange the cards in their Food Loop. As the game progresses cards from higher tiers will become available in the shop.
3. **Battle Screen** – The player is paired against an opponent, and the battle is shown. Whichever player hits their "star point" target first wins.
4. **Results** – show win/loss/draw; return to Shop for next round.
5. **Game End** - Players start with 5 lives. When they lose a battle they lose a life. When they win a battle, they get a trophy. If the player gets 10 trophies they win, if they lose 5 lives they lose the game.

## 🧩 2. Game Overview

- **Food Card:** Each food card will have a shop cost, a cooldown value, category tags, tier, and abilities.
- **Food Loop:** Players will create a list of cards called a Food Loop. During battles this list of food cards will activate sequentially in a loop. After each loop, judge cards are activated.
- **Card Categories:** Each food card will have at least one category. Categories will be used for certain abilities. Example categories: Mexican, Asian, Italian, Fast Food, Delicacy, etc.
- **Types of Points:** Some food card abilities will generate different types of points. Savory points will be generated by savory foods for example. Throughout a battle, certain effects will convert points into star points.
- **Abilities:** Food cards can have two types of abiliities: basic abilities and/or triggered abilities. Basic abilities are activated when the food card's cooldown is reached. "+5 Savory Points" for example. Triggered abilities are activated by a specified trigger. For example: "Whenever a Mexican Food Card is activated, give +1 Savory points"
- **Judges:** Judges are a certain type of card that is separate from the Food Cards. They can be purchased and added to Judge slots. Judges convert points into "Star Points." Some judges like Savory dishes, so they will have an ability to convert Savory Points into Star Points for example. Judge abilities activate separately from the food loop cards. Some will have cooldowns, some will be triggered.

## 🧩 3. User Interface

- **UI/UX Basics:** The whole game should be playable with a phone in vertical orientation. The app UI is to be "mobile-first". Cards will be shown as small square sprites. When you click them, a tool-tip window will show the cards information. The app should not redirect to different URLs, it should be playable in one screen.

- **Shop Screen** The shop screen will show the player's food loop list and the player's judge slots in the top half of the window. The bottom half of the window will have the food cards for sale and a separarte area for judge cards for sale. The player should be able to drag and drop items from the shop areas into the food loop area to purchase them. To sell items players should be able to drag and drop items from the food card or judge area into a designated sell location. The shop screen will also show game information like what round it is, lives, trophies, and player money.

- **Battle Screen** The battle screen will show the player's information at the bottom half of the screen and the opponents information at the top half of the screen. It will show each player's food loop list, and each player's judges. There will be a visual indicator to show when cards are activated and which one is on cooldown to be activated. It will show point totals for all the different point types. And it will show each player's Star Point Target.

## 🧩 4. Battle Logic

- **Battle Logic:** Battles will be shown to the player in the battle screen. The player will not have any actions to perform, and should be blocked from rearranging cards or imposing on the battle as it plays out.

Players will start the battle with 0 points. Each player may have a different Star Point Target.

The battle will start when the player enters the battle screen.

When the battle starts, the first food card in each of the player's food loops will begin it's countdown. When it reaches it's countdown time, it will be activated and the game engine will move to the next food card in the player's food loop list. The next card will start its countdown and so on. When the final card in a player's list is activated, the enine will move to the first card in the player's list. The battle will continue looping until a player reaches their Star Point Target, or until the battle lasts 20 seconds. If the player reaches their Star Point Target before the opposing player, they win the battle and get a trophy. If they opposing player reaches their Star Point Target, the player loses the battle and loses a life. If the time runs out, the player with the most Star Points wins. If it is a tie, the player does not lose a life or gain a trophy.
