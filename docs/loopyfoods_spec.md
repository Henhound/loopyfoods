2. **Shop Screen** – Player can buy and sell food cards. There will also be a separate area to buy/sell judge cards. The player can also rearrange the cards in their Food Loop. As the game progresses cards from higher tiers will become available in the shop.
3. **Battle Screen** – The player is paired against an opponent, and the battle is shown. Whichever player hits their "star point" target first wins.

## 🧩 2. Game Overview

- **Food Card:** Each food card will have a shop cost, a cooldown value, category tags, tier, and abilities.
- **Food Loop:** Players will create a list of cards called a Food Loop. During battles this list of food cards will activate sequentially in a loop. After each loop, judge cards are activated.
- **Card Categories:** Each food card will have at least one category. Categories will be used for certain abilities. Example categories: Mexican, Asian, Italian, Fast Food, Delicacy, etc.
- **Types of Points:** Some food card abilities will generate different types of points. Savory points will be generated by savory foods for example. Throughout a battle, certain effects will convert points into star points.
- **Abilities:** Food cards can have two types of abiliities: basic abilities and/or triggered abilities. Basic abilities are activated when the food card's cooldown is reached. "+5 Savory Points" for example. Triggered abilities are activated by a specified trigger. For example: "Whenever a Mexican Food Card is activated, give +1 Savory points"
- **Judges:** Judges are a certain type of card that is separate from the Food Cards. They can be purchased and added to Judge slots. Judges convert points into "Star Points." Some judges like Savory dishes, so they will have an ability to convert Savory Points into Star Points for example. Judge abilities activate once after each food loop.
